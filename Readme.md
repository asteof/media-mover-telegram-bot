# media-mover-telegram-bot

Simple bot created for moving photos and videos across two chats.
Suppose you have 2 telegram groups. You save photos in first group and videos in second.

It can be a little tiresome to do that by hand and this bot is helping to resolve the issue.

When you send photos or videos or even albums containing both,
bot will forward it to your groups accordingly.

The bot can successfully handle albums, so that UI in Telegram seems flawless.

To use locally:

`npm run dev`

It compiles bot from TS to JS and runs it on Node.js environment.
